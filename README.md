## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

- Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console) for "YT Equity Plus" debug messages
- Verify the extension is enabled in your browser's extension manager
- Try refreshing the YouTube page

### Button Not Appearing

- Make sure you're on a valid YouTube page (video or channel)
- Check if the channel identifier is being detected (see console logs)
- Try different YouTube pages

### Data Not Loading

- Check browser console for data loading errors
- Verify `data/channels.json` file exists in the extension folder

## Development

The extension uses a unified `content.js` file that works across both Chrome and Firefox by detecting the available browser APIs automatically.

Debug logging can be viewed in the browser console with the prefix "YT Equity Plus:".
